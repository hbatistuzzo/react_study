React (React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library maintained by Meta and its community. This study will focus on the React Native library for mobile app development, while also covering the essentials from the core library.

ðŸ”¹React Native: has 2 main parts, the graphical interface (UI, developed with JSX) and the logic through javascript. JSX generates native components either for iOS or Android. The logic will work inside runtimes through Webkit (for iOS) or V8 (for Android).

>__OBS:__ First attemps

ðŸ”¹ `npm install` in the project folder will download and install any 3rd party packages needed for a project, for example the react libraries and the build process tools that transform the React code to code that works in the browser.

ðŸ”¹ `npm run dev` starts the development server so that we can preview the website where the React app is in action.
